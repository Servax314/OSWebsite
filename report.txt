The differents variables used to implement the strategy: 

bool loaded_robot
bool edge_detected 
bool obstacle_touched
bool empty
bool destination_container
int heading // -1 south / +1 north (top of the map) 
int robot_y_position

The different functions (names are self-explanatory):  

find_next_container:
This function is reponsible to find the next container in the map. For that, the function needs to monitor if an edge is detected (edge_detected). It also needs the heading of the robot to position it. Furthermore, it needs to know if the unknown cube has already been spotted or not (unknown_cube) to perform the move_toward_the_wall function. 

type_of_container:
To know the type of the container spotted by the sonar we need to know:
- the heading of the robot 
- the position of the robot on the y axis 
- the positions of all the containers on the y axis 
Examples:
If the robot is in the first zone (unknown zone) then the cube is the unknown cube.
If the robot heads north (top of the map) then the cube is a cube containing balls.

container_is_adapted:
To know whether or not the container is adapted we have to look at different flags:
- loaded_robot  
- flags of the container (empty, destination_container) 
Examples: 
The container is adapted if the robot is loaded and the container is a container where we have to put balls. We can have additional constraints: previous conditions + the cube has to be empty.

go_to_container:
To go to the container spotted we need to know the heading of the robot and the action to perform (grabbing or releasing the balls) when the cube is hurted (obstacle_touched).
